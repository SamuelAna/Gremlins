        <p>
            Gremlins is the story of a man who buys his son, Billy, a new pet. It’s an innocent looking creature, 
            called a mogwai.

            Billy immediatly takes to the teddy bear like creature with it's cute singing and names it Gizmo.
            Gizmo however, comes with 3 rules:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Avoid btight lights, especially sunlight, which can kill it.</li>
            <li>Don’t get it wet</li>
            <li>No feeding after midnight.</li>
        </ol>

        <p> 
            Billy breaks rules 2 and 3, which cause the mogwai to multiply, and change into an evil hideous 
            creature known as a gremlin, respectively.

            From there the film takes a dark turn, as the Gremlins 
            descend on the town attacking people, destroying things, and generally wreaking havoc.
