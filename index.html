        Billy immediatly takes to the teddy bear like creature with it's cute singing and names it Gizmo.
        Gizmo however, comes with 3 rules:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Avoid btight lights, especially sunlight, which can kill it.</li>
        <li>Don’t get it wet</li>
        <li>No feeding after midnight.</li>
    </ol>

    <p> 
        Billy breaks rules 2 and 3, which cause the mogwai to multiply, and change into an evil hideous 
        creature known as a gremlin, respectively.
